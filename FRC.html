          <h2>What is Robotics?</h2>
          <p> The Irvine High School Robotics Team consists of about 50 members divided between three main teams, Hardware, CAD, and Software. Each year we take part in the FIRST Robotics Competition, an annual robotics competition held throughout the US. Each year consists of a different game for which teams must design robots. The robots will compete in a series of 3 on 3 matches in which ultimately the top 24 teams are moved up individual brackets. The teams have 3 months to brainstorm, design, build, and test the robot.

          <h2>Competition Session</h2>
          <p> Joining the Robotics Team in August of 2022 I began working with the CAD team. Quickly picking up this new skill I began to design parts during and outside of meetings. During competition sessions, I quickly became someone the mentor relied on to make the harder parts. I was given the difficult task of designing a claw mechanism for the robot. First, brainstorming, and making four different designs I began to compare them to each other. Finally, we settled on one using pneumatic pistons and double-layered polycarbonate. Along with this, I also designed the arm mechanism, which was used to lift the claw up and down as well as extend it, side panels, to protect the electrical board but still allow easy access for repairs, and the driving station which was to be cared by 
the driver during the competition.

        <h2>Post Session </h2>
        <p>Robotics has allowed me to expand my passion for STEM. Even outside of the workshop I continue to use skills that I learned. Over the summer, I designed a robot for a previous year's FIRST competition in just under 4 weeks. The robot consisted of a climber, gear scoring, and fuel scoring mechanism. Each is elaborately designed through meticulous calculations and simulations. This new skill also provided me with the opportunity to join SoccerBots. Due to my prior knowledge of CAD, I was promoted to Engineering Design Lead in SoccerBots and constructed various of CAD models for friends and family. (both can be found in the SoccerBots project section.
