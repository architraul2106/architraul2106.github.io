              <h2>The Classes </h2>
              <p> The first year of the workshop, we publized Tutorium through websites like Facebook, Whatsapp, and
                Nextdoor and got a total of 25 registrations. Due to the positive feedback from both parents and students,
                we decided to continue these workshops for the summer of 2023. We didn't hold back, the team continued to
                push forward, adding the Python programming and 4th grade math class to the mix. Also, we hired student
                volenteers to also aid in teaching the courses leading to a total of 10 classes rather than the 8 from the
                prior year. </p>

          <h2>Future Plans</h2>
          <p> Over this year we plan on expanding to involve more than 4 other schools throughout the Orange County
            including , Orange High, Garden Grove and Westminster. Also, to accomadate more students from around Orange
            County we have plans to expand to 2 more locations. These locations will be lead mostly by the new high
            schools. However, one of our biggest goals is to be able to be endourced by schools who have a multitude of
            struggling students, from this we can give specific students more attention and through contact with their
            teachers we hope that it would make their learning experience more compatable. </p>
