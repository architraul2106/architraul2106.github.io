          <h2>What is Robotics?</h2>
          <p> The Irvine High School Robotics Team consists of about 50 members divided between three main teams,
            Hardware,CAD, and Software. Each year we take part in the FIRST Robotics Competition, an annually robotics
            competition held throughout the US. Each year consists of a different game for which teams must design
            robots for. The robots must compete in a series of 3 on 3 matches in which untimately the top 24 teams are
            moved up individual brackets. The teams have 3 months to brainstorm, design, build and test the robot. </p>

          <h2>Competition Session</h2>
          <p> Joining the Robotics Team in August of 2022 I began working with the CAD team. Quickly picking up this new
            skill I began to design parts during and outside of meetings. During competition session, I quickly became
            someone the mentor relied on to make the harder parts. I was given the difficult task of designing a claw
            mechanism for the robot. First, brainstorming, making four different designs I began to compare them to each
            other. Finally settling on one using pnuetamic pistons and double layered polycarbonate. Along with this, I
            also designed the arm mechanism,which was used to lift the claw up and down as well as extend it, side panels,
            to protect the electrical board but still allow easy access for repairs, and the driving station which was to
            be cared by the driver during the competition. </p>

        <h2>Post Session </h2>
        <p> Robotics has allowed me to expand my passion for STEM. Even outside of the workshop I continue to use skills
          that I learned. Over the summer, I designed a robot for a previous year FIRST competition in just under 4
          weeks. The robot consisted of climber, gear scoring, and fuel scoring mechanism. Each elaboratly designed
          through maticulous calculations and simulations. This new skill also provided me with the oppourtunity to join
          SoccerBots. Due to my prior knowledge of CAD I was promoted to Engineering Design Lead and aided in the
          creation of a goalie and kicker mechanisms. (both can be found in the SoccerBots project section. </p>
