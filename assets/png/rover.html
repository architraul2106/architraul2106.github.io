          <h2>What is it?</h2>
          <p> This was a topic I chose to pursue during my Aerospace Engineering class at Irvine High School. The project was divided into two sections. In part 1 we had to create a hyperealistic research paper about a mission to Mars. Part 2 consisted of designing a rover that would be able to navigate around obstacles like boxes, bumps, and curves set up by our instructor.

              <h2>Research Paper</h2>
              <p>
		My group consisted of three others however I quickly took the role of manager and started setting up assignments for each team member. We chose to have our rover find proof of water on Mars. To do this, we chose to land in the Nili Fossae valley located on Mars in search silicon rich rocks. As silicon is a good absorber of water, by opening up these rocks we could find remaining water particles. We also researched about specific equipment required for this rover, these including sensors,cameras, trackers, and claw to collect rocks. By looking at past NASA rovers we found many of the parts that we required for this hyporealistic mission. I also, created a CAD model of the robot, showing the extensive equipment on it.

              <h2>Vex Robot</h2>
</p>
              For part 2 my team designed a tank drive rover from the VEX parts avaiable to us. The robot could be ran autonomously or remote controlled. The tank  threads provided good grip to rough surfaces as well as a simiple turning mechanism. By attaching a range finder to the found of the robot we could detect obstacles and the robot could self-manuever around them. Due to the low quality equipment avialble to us, we faced many problems with accurate turns. Due to   small batteries, when the batteries started to run low we would see a decrease in turning accuracy leading to us having to change our coding values to potential have to the robot work. However, through our struggle we finally found success, having the robot clear the obstable course multiple times.
