          <h2>The Presentation</h2>
          <p> The Aerospace class was divided so that each group had four members and then assigned a topic. My group got the topic of Ramjets. As part of the project, we had to create a presentation to example the history, modern use, and componenets of the ramjet. Also, we were to design a 3D model to display to the class, demonstating how the ramjet works. </p>

          
              <h2>The model</h2>
              <p>The model was made of Syforam we found in the classroom. Half of the ramjet could be removed to show how air flowed to create so much power. When air entered through the front it would go thro compresion under a head chamber and then be suddenly expanded which will cause it to expell out the back leading to a large amount of pressure. The model was well labelled and displayed the research we had done on the topic. We also, created another model made from cardboard which showed the very first type of ramjet which was made back in 1949. It showed how now instead of a simple chamber to expell air the ramjet would take in air from the side to cool down the heated air
