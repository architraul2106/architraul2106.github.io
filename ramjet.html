          <h2>The Presentation</h2>
          <p>  The Aerospace class was divided so that each group had four members and then assigned a topic. My group got the topic of Ramjets. As part of the project, we had to create a presentation to illustrate the history, modern use, and components of the ramjet. Also, we were to design a 3D model to display to the class, demonstrating how the ramjet works.
 </p>

          
              <h2>The Model</h2>
              <p>The model was made of Syforam we found in the classroom. Half of the ramjet could be removed to show how air flowed to create so much power. When air entered through the front it would go through compression under a head chamber and then be suddenly expanded which would cause it to expel out the back leading to a large amount of pressure. The model was well-labeled and displayed the research we had done on the topic. We also created another model made from cardboard which showed the very first type of ramjet which was made back in 1949. It showed how now instead of a simple chamber to expel air the ramjet would take in air from the side to cool down the heated air.
