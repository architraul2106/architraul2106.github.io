          <h2>What is SoccerBots?</h2>
          <p>The competition designed under the partnership of ROAD2 Educational Organization, UCI Samueli School of Engineering, and Orphan Assistance Fund aims to bring STEM in an interactive and engaging way to underprivileged children in Orange County. Teams of 3 will face each other in matches to advance to the next round, attempting to “score goals” with their Soccerbot on the other team’s net.

          <h2>Leading the Charge</h2>
          <p>Rising to the position of Engineering Department Lead, I was in charge of 15 individuals. Our job was to design the five different robots—goalie, midfielder, striker, defender, and speedster— with each robot having its own advantages. Not only did I lead the team but also contributed to a multitude of areas. As I had the most experience with CAD on the team, putting aside positions, I helped my team design many of the parts such as a slider-crank mechanism, the arena, and the chassis of the robot. Also, working with the marketing team, I pitched the program to a multitude of sponsors, securing sponsorships from Walmart, IEEE, and Robotis.

          <h2>Competition</h2>
          </p>
          Hosting an event for 125 kids, each team of three will be given a robot kit which they will use to build the robot in a two-hour time period. Each kit was put together by the engineering team making it both fast and easy to build. Participants will also have the option to pick between the five different robot attachments - goalie, midfielder, striker, defender, speedster. The teams will be randomized for the competition with 3 robots on each team. The winner of the tournament will be provided with a scholarship as well as gifts from our sponsors.
