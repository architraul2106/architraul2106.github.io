          <h2>What is SoccerBots?</h2>
          <p>The competition designed under the partnership of ROAD2 Educational Organization, UCI Samueli School of Engineering, and Orphan Assistance Fund aims to bring STEM in an interactive and engaging way to underprivileged children in Orange County. Teams of 3 will face each other in matches to advance to the next round, attempting to ‚Äúscore goals‚Äù with their Soccerbot on the other team‚Äôs net.

          <h2>Leading the Charge</h2>
          <p>Rising to the position of Engineering Department Lead, I was in charge of 15 individuals. Our job was to
            design the five different robots‚Äîgoalie, midfielder, striker, defender, speedster‚Äî with each robot having
            its own advantages. Not only did I lead the team but also contributed to a multitude of areas. As I had the
            most experience with CAD on the team, putting aside positions, I helped my team design many of the parts
            such as a slider-crank mechanism, the arena, and the chassis of the robot. Also, working with the marketing
            team, I pitched the program to a multitude of sponsors, securing sponsorships from Walmart, IEEE, and
            Robotis.</p>

          <h2>Competition</h2>
          </p>
          Hosting an event for 125 kids, each team of three will be given a robot kit which they will use to build the
          robot in a two hour time period. Each kit was put together by the engineering team making it both fast and
          easy
          to build. Participants will also have the optional to pick between the five different robot attachments -
          goalie, midfielder, striker, defender, speedster. The teams will be randomized for the competition with 3
          robots
          on each team. Winner of the tournament will be provided with a scholarship as well as gifts from our sponsers.
